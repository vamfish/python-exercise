# What Do You Know So Far

> 1. First, go back through every exercise you have done so far and write down every word and symbol that you have used. Make sure your list of symbols is complete.  
> 2. Next to each word or symbol, write its name and what it does. If you do not know what a word or symbol does, then read about it again and try using it in some code.  
> 3. Memorize the list and what they do.
